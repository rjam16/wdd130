                <p>In the 1940s, world fairs encouraged millions to demonstrate their ideas and talents.</p> 
                <p>This included a very rudimentary design for the first electronic game. Hardly any player</p>

                <p>Computers remained the hub for electronic games. New computing languages made in colleges like</p>
