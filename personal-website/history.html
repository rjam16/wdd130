                        <p>In the 1940s, world fairs encouraged millions to demonstrate their ideas and talents.</p> 
                        <p>This included a very rudimentary design for the first electronic game.</p>
                        <p>Hardly any player could win against the machine, but it displayed the potential for future electronic endeavors.</p>

                        <p>Computers could run simulations to play games like chess or tic-tac-toe, but it wasn’t until 1958 that the game “Pong” would be invented.</p>
                        <p>It was not the first 'video game' but it did bring attention to the idea of one. This game was one of few available on the first gaming console made by Ralph Baer in 1968, 10 years later!</p>

                        <p>New computing languages made in colleges like Dartmouth or MIT aided in game creation.</p>
                        <p>Most creators were still hesitant to broach the visual aspect of game creation, so games followed a style similar to “Choose Your Own Adventure” books.</p>
