    <p>There isn't much to me, but I'll try my best if you're curious.</p>
    <p>I've attempted anything creative and tend to pick up them up as hobbies quickly. I draw, paint, sew, bake, write, sculpt, design, and produce music. I can't say whether I'm great at most of them, but it doesn't matter as long as it's fun. Despite my attempt to mingle, I am currently single.</p>
    <p>I currently work at a small dental office as an insurance coordinator, but I hope by getting a software development degree and an internship, I'll be able to have my dream career as a video game designer.</p>
    <p>I've never attended BYUI in-person as I'm an online-only student, so the most I can say is that it seems pretty open in both community and opportunities.</p>
    <p>Honestly, I wasn't sure how to feel about web design. Now that I'm out in the working world, I understand how such a skill is an advantage in employment. I also get an idea of why websites do and do not work.</p>
    <p>I grew up as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. My favorite quote from general conference quote was from Elder Holland in the October 2017 General Conference in his talk "Be Ye Therefore Perfect - Eventually".</p>
    <p>"For such a perfect moment, I continue to strive, however clumsily. For such a perfect gift, I continue to give thanks, however inadequately. I do so in the very name of Perfection itself, of Him who has never been clumsy or inadequate but who loves all of us who are".</p>
    <p>My favorite scripture is either Moroni 8:25-26 or 1 Corinthians 10:13.</p>
    <p>I'm more introverted, which explains my hobbies, but I'm always up for an escape room or trying something new. Take this class for example!</p>
